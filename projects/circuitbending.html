            <p>Circuit bending is the practive of hacking old technology by adding or breaking components inside. This can yield completely different new devices with
            all sorts of wierd behaviour. In the inspiration section of my portfolio you can see more on what other people have made.<br><br>
            At the beginning of module 2 I got inspired by some YouTue videos showing their hacked circuits. After these videos I bought myself some supplies needed
            to circuit bend and I started looking for thinks I could hack (see the <i>old tech</i> page of my portfolio)</p>
            <p>I haven't done a lot so far, but I have broken open a TomTom device and a laptop to just look inside and get a feel for the circuits, I also
            reverse engineered the code on the TomTom to see how it works. As soon as I have some progress to show it will be uploaded on this page.</p>
