            <p>Not satisfied with the existing SPotify app, I set out to create my own using their public API</p>

            <p>Using HTML, CSS and Node.js I programmed my own interface for the popular music app. 
                However, the system behind it is different. Ever since Spotify updated their playlist system,
                I have wanter to change it. My system is based on tags, not on playlists. However in the backend system,
                they are treaded as the same to make the integration smooth.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is still in development, but I have made some good progress. The app is currently able to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Login using Spotify</li>
                    <li>Show your saved songs</li>
                    <li>Search for songs</li>
                    <li>Create and edit tags</li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <p>
                The main different is that on my app, you can search more accuratelly, for example you
                can choose to include all the tracks with the tag 'house' but not the onces which also have
                the tag 'vocal'. This way you can easily filter out songs you don't want to hear.
                Then you can immediately play the songs or add them to a temporary playlist.
